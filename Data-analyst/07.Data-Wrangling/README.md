## Intro

**Armenian Online Job Postings**

The online job market is a good indicator of overall demand for labor in an economy. This dataset consists of 19,000 job postings from 2004 to 2015 posted on CareerCenter, an Armenian human resource portal.

Since postings are text documents and tend to have similar structures, text mining can be used to extract features like posting date, job title, company name, job description, salary, and more. Postings that had no structure or were not job-related were removed. The data was originally scraped from a Yahoo! mailing group

## Gathering data

**Best of Rotten Tomatoes**

How do you pick which movie to watch? You may check movie rating websites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb to help you chose. These sites contain a number of different metrics which are used to evaluate whether or not you will like a movie. However, because these metrics do not always show on the same page, figuring out the best movies can get confusing.

We can start with the [Rotten Tomatoes: Top 100 Movies of All Time](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/). (Note: this current list may be different than the latest archived list used in this lesson). We can use a scatter plot to look at audience scores vs critics scores for each movie.

For lots of people, Roger Ebert's movie review was the only review they needed because he explained the movie in such a way that they would know whether they would like it or not. Wouldn't it be neat if we had a word cloud like this one for each of the movies in the top 100 list at [RogerEbert.com](http://www.rogerebert.com/)? We can use a [Andreas Mueller's Word Cloud Generator](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) in Python to help.
