# SVM Algorithm

## Separating line

The goal of Support Vector Machines algorithm is to find a line which separates different classes in the best way.

THe best line maximizes the distance to the nearest points in both classes. This distance is called *margin*.

Support Vector Machines puts forward the correct classification and then, subject to that constraint, maximizes the margin.

The other line maximizes to some point the distance between classes but makes a classification error. 

## Outliers 

If the data can not be linearly separated due to outliers, Support Vector Machines will do the best it can. It linearly separates the classes with maximized distance between their points and it is tolerant to outliers - the points that happen to be on the other side.
