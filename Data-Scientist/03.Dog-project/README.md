## Project Overview

In this project, we will build a classification model that may be applied to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

We will use different existing models for human face detection as well as for dog identification. We will compare different architectures (simple CNN architecture and Transfer Learning) in order to predict a dog breed for a given picture (if a human or a dog is detected).

## Main Results

To evaluate all the models we use **accuracy score**, the [most famous classification performance indicator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05756.pdf). Accuracy returns an overall measure of how much the model is correctly predicting the classification of a single individual above the entire set of data.

1. To detect human faces we use **OpenCV**'s implementation of **Haar feature-based cascade classifiers**. They show a perfect accuracy in detecting human faces (100%), however, they were also able to detect humans on dog pictures (in 10% of cases).

2. To detect dogs we use a pre-trained **ResNet-50** model. It performs better than the previous human detector: 100% of dogs detected on dogs pictures; 0% dogs detected on human pictures. 

3. Finally, to detect dog breeds we use three different models:

    - Our first model uses **CNN**s with different layers and resulted in 4.67% accuracy.

    - Our second model uses Transfer Learning with bottleneck features of the **VGG-16** model; it results in 42.58% accuracy.

    - Our third model uses Transfer Learning as well, but with bottleneck features of the **Inception** model; it results in 77.75% accuracy.

### Run the project on the local machine, V1

Create (and activate) a new environment.

- __Linux__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-linux.yml` to `requirements/dog-linux-gpu.yml`): 

```
conda env create -f requirements/dog-linux.yml
source activate dog-project
```

- __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-mac.yml` to `requirements/dog-mac-gpu.yml`):

```
conda env create -f requirements/dog-mac.yml
source activate dog-project
```

**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV

```
conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
```

- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-windows.yml` to `requirements/dog-windows-gpu.yml`):

```
conda env create -f requirements/dog-windows.yml
activate dog-project
```

### Run the project on the local machine, V2

If V1 throws errors, try this __alternative__ to create your environment.

- __Linux__ or __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`):

```
conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
source activate dog-project
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV

```
conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
```

- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`):

```
conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
activate dog-project
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

### IPython kernel

- Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `dog-project` environment.

```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dog-project --display-name "dog-project"
```

Open the notebook.

```
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

- Before running code, change the kernel to match the dog-project environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > dog-project**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.
