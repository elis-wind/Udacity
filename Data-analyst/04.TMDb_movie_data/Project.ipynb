    "1. During this analysis we have found several \"the most ... movie\"! The most popular film is Jurasic World. The longest film is Band of Brothers (12h which makes sense since it's mini series). The highest budget seems to have been allocated to The Warrior's Way and the film with the highest revenue is Avatar.\n",
    "2. The most produced movie genre of all the time is drama, except for 80s where there were more comedies than any other type of movie.\n",

    "4. We also found some patterns about top 20 movies with the highest revenue:\n",
    "    - their revenue is way higher than their budget;\n",
    "    - they have a good rating (more than 7) and on average they last more than 2 hours;\n",
    "    - most of the keywords are associated with Marvel comics universe\n",
    "    - Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp appear 3 times in these 20 films! Robert Downey Jr. plays in movies based on Marvel comics; Johnny Depp - twice in Pirates of the Caribbean and once in Alice in Wonderland."

    "1. It would be nice to have more information about the data set composition: \n",
    "    - for instance, what exactly is the popularity? We found out that the most \"popular\" film is Jurasic Park but we do not know what exactly it means, since there is a different column for ratings;\n",
    "    - what types of movies are included into this data set? Based on our findings we can conclude that not only films but also TV-series are included. It would be nice to have a psecific column for this purpose, so we can find easily the longest movie and the longest TV-series.\n",
    "2. Some results may be not relevant, since the data may contain misleading information (double-checked in Google and/or Wikipedia): for instance, the longest film (Band of Brothers) is not a film but a mini series; the film with the highest budget (The Warrior's Way) might have a real budget which is 10 times lower.
