    "1. Some results may be not relevant, since the data may contain misleading information (double-checked in Google and/or Wikipedia): for instance, the longest film (Band of Brothers) is not a film but a mini series; the film with the highest budget (The Warrior's Way) might have a real budget which is 10 times lower. However, the information about the most popular film (Jurasic World) and the film with the highest revenue (Avatar) seems to be accurate.\n",
    "2. The most produced movie genre of all the time is drama, except for 80s where there were more comedies than any other type of movie.\n",
    "3. The top 5 movies with the highest revenue, after Avatar, are Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Titanic, The Avengers and Jurasic World (the latter is also the most popular movie)\n",
    "4. We also found some patterns about top 20 movies with the highest revenue:\n",
    "    - their revenue is way higher than their budget;\n",
    "    - they have a good rating (more than 7) and on average they last more than 2 hours;\n",
    "    - most of the keywords are associated with Marvel comics universe\n",
    "    - Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp appear 3 times in these 20 films! Robert Downey Jr. plays in movies based on Marvel comics; Johnny Depp - twice in Pirates of the Caribbean and once in Alice in Wonderland."
